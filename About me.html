        <h3>I am a 37 year old woman taking her first steps in th Web Development world.<p> I work full time, sometimes even 3 shifts but it still does not stop me from learning.<p>I have always been curious how the Internet pages actually work and what is <p> beneath the surface. Now when I get to know how it is created, I want to start<p> creating my own. Knowing English is undoubtedly an enormous benefit as the best <p> courses for self- learners ar in that language.<p>I truly hope that after some time (it is not a race) I will be able to present you,<p>what I have accomplished on a more advanced level than the page you see now.<p>Please keep your fingers crossed, I will also do my best in that matter<p><br/>
